# Introduction

Hello, I'm merik, but you can call me sza, merika or even just merik.<br>
I don't accept any friend requests on the platforms I'm active on, therefore probably the only contact with me is github.<br>
If you appreciate what I make, feel free to support me on my [Buy Me A Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/merika).<br>
I also have a neglected [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_y4e6mu8SwCLxjRNl2NLQ).<br>

# My projects

Here's a list of the projects I've started and worked on:

## [Lite Uninstaller](https://github.com/szaaamerik/Lite-Uninstaller)

This tool is not finished yet. Its purpose is to be a free and open source application uninstaller, similar to Revo or Uninstall Tool.

## [Forza Mods AIO](https://github.com/ForzaMods/AIO)

I'm currently working on the V2 version of this tool.

## [Forza Mods Fov Menu](https://github.com/ForzaMods/Fov-Menu)

I previously worked on this tool, which is entirely my project. I'm not sure if it still works, and I haven't tested it recently.

## [Forza Mods Car Table](https://github.com/ForzaMods/Car-Table)

I fully developed the V1 version of this tool. While I don't claim credit for anything apart from the the UI in the V2 version, I contributed to its creation.

## [Forza Mods Mod Manager](https://github.com/ForzaMods/Mod-Manager)

I'm the one to start the foundation for this project. It's not finished. It hasn't been actively worked on as I lost interest in it.

## [Forza Mods Website](https://github.com/ForzaMods/website)

I created the V1 version of this website, one of my first projects that went public. It was rushed due to the necessity of including most of the guides on it. I abandoned it since I dont like web development.

## [Forza Mods Live Editing](https://github.com/ForzaMods/Forza-Mods-Live-Editing)

I quickly made this tool to help model-swappers in live editing when a recompiled cheat engine wasn't sufficient for this game. Although t's not very good.
